    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food <i>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</i> into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,<dfn> Cooking for Geeks</dfn>, Jeff Potter describes it <cite>as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p></cite>
    
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Next month, we will be serving <em>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</em>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2016-11-30"> November 30.</p></time>

    <p><b><u>Warning:</u></b> Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p>
